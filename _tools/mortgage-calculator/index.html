    <h2>Mortgage Payment Formula</h2>
    <p>The formula for calculating your monthly mortgage payment is:</p>
    <p><strong>M = P[r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>M</strong> is your total monthly mortgage payment.</li>
        <li><strong>P</strong> is the principal loan amount.</li>
        <li><strong>r</strong> is your monthly interest rate. This is your annual interest rate divided by 12.</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong> is your number of payments (the number of months you will be paying the loan).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This formula is used to calculate the fixed monthly payment required to fully pay off a mortgage over a term of years, taking into account the interest rate.</p>
