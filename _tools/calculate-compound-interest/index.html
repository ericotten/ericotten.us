    <h2>Compound Interest Formula</h2>
    <p>The formula for calculating compound interest is:</p>
    <p><strong>A = P(1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A</strong> is the amount of money accumulated after <strong>n</strong> years, including interest.</li>
        <li><strong>P</strong> is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).</li>
        <li><strong>r</strong> is the annual interest rate (in decimal form).</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong> is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.</li>
        <li><strong>t</strong> is the time the money is invested for in years.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Compound interest is calculated by multiplying the initial principal amount by one plus the annual interest rate raised to the power of the number of compound periods minus one. The total initial amount of the loan is then added to the resulting value, leading to the accumulation of interest upon interest, which is the key to its growth.</p>
